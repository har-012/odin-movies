        <em>Pulihora (or Pulihora, Pulihora, Puliyogare) is a tangy, spicy, and aromatic South Indian rice dish made with cooked rice, tamarind (or lemon/kokum), curry leaves, peanuts, lentils (urad dal, chana dal), chilies, turmeric, and other spices, often prepared as a temple offering (prasadam) or for festivals, known for its distinctive flavor from a special tempering and spice powder. It's popular in Andhra Pradesh, Telangana
            , Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Kerala, with variations like Pulihora gojju (paste) or Pulihora podi (powder) made ahead for quick preparation</em>

        </ul>

        <h3>Making</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cook the Rice:</li>
            <p>Cook rice (like Sona Masoori) with a pinch of turmeric, salt, and a drop of oil, 
            ensuring grains stay separate (not mushy). Spread it on a plate to cool completely.</p>
            <br>

            <li>Extract Tamarind Pulp:</li>
            <p>Soak tamarind in hot water, then squeeze and strain to get a thick pulp.</p>
            <br>

            <li>Prepare the Tempering (Popu):</li>
            <p>Heat oil and fry mustard seeds, peanuts, chana dal,
             urad dal until golden and fragrant. Add curry leaves, green chilies, and dry red chilies.</p>
            <br>

            <li>Make the Paste (Goju):</li>
            <p>Add the tamarind pulp, turmeric powder, salt, and a bit of jaggery (optional) to the tempering.
            Cook on low heat until the mixture thickens and oil separates, forming a pulpy paste.</p>
            <br>

            <li>Combine:</li>
            <p>Add the cooled rice
            to the thickened tamarind paste (or vice versa) and mix gently so rice grains don't break</p>
            <br>

            <li>Final Touch (Optional):</li>
            <p>Some recipes add a final
            seasoning of mustard seeds, peanuts, and curry leaves fried in oil, mixed into the rice</p>
