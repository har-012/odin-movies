        <em>Hyderabadi Chicken Biryani - Swasthi's Recipes
            Biryani is a fragrant, mixed rice dish from South Asia, layering aromatic spices, long-grain rice (often basmati), and marinated meat (chicken, lamb, goat), seafood, or vegetables, creating a rich, flavorful main course with numerous regional variations, often slow-cooked in sealed pots for deep flavor infusion. Its name comes from the Persian word for "fried" or "roasted," and it's known for its complex 
            flavors from ingredients like saffron, yogurt, mint, and caramelized onions. </em>\
