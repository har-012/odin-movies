    <em>Butter Chicken (Murgh Makhani) is a popular Indian curry featuring marinated chicken in a rich, creamy, spiced tomato-based sauce, known for its mild, buttery, and slightly sweet flavor profile, often made with yogurt-marinated chicken cooked then simmered in a smooth sauce of tomatoes, butter, cream, and aromatics like
    ginger, garlic, and fenugreek leaves (kasuri methi), typically served with naan or rice</em>
